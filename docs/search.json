    "text": "Biography\n\nBrayden Boyko, a fourth-year finance major at the University of Alberta, has cultivated a robust and diverse skill set through both academic and professional experiences. With a passion for quantitative finance, Brayden has demonstrated his abilities in various roles.\nDuring his tenure as a Financial Analyst Intern with Grainger Canada’s Finance team in Toronto, he optimized and automated cost analysis processes, significantly reducing the time spent on weekly tasks. He modeled the impact of freight and foreign exchange on operating expenses and cost of goods sold. Additionally, Brayden built business partner PowerBi dashboards for segment revenue tracking, goal planning, forecasting, and impacts. His initiative and dedication were evident as he took on roles beyond internship expectations, particularly during times of team transition, and handled monthly financial reporting for three business segments.\nContinuing with Grainger Canada remotely, Brayden’s contract was extended to support the operations finance team. He automated data collection and mapping processes for millions of SKUs using Python and automated standard cost calculation processes with Snowflake. His efforts provided executives with a comprehensive dataset of week-ahead cost changes and measured cost and price inflation through Python automation, complemented by monthly commentary on OPEX and Revenue through improved PowerBi dashboards.\nAs the founder of Boyko Wealth, Brayden developed automated advanced model reports on approximately 62,000 assets for small-to-medium sized asset management firms. Utilizing VBA, Excel, Python, and Google Drive API, he created an online client dashboard available at boykowealth.com. The automated models encompassed a wide range of financial analyses, including terminal value (DCF), credit rating systems, weighted-risk analysis, statistical analysis, volatility analysis (GARCH), probability analysis, bond pricing and sensitivity, stress testing, industry analysis, and stochastic forecasting. Brayden is also developing an investment research desktop terminal that provides data on 2.5 million assets and connects key markets. He has led a team of student analysts to deliver comprehensive quantitative research in equities, commodities, and credit markets.\nIn addition to his finance expertise, Brayden has been an elite-level referee with Hockey Alberta in the Greater Edmonton Area since 2016. He has officiated at the elite minor levels of U17AAA, U15AAA, and Academy Hockey and has volunteered as a referee for QuickCard Edmonton Minor Hockey Week eight times, also serving as a volunteer officials development supervisor.\nBrayden holds several designations and certificates, including the Canadian Securities Course (CSC) from the Canadian Securities Institute and the Bloomberg Market Concepts certificate. His academic achievements have been recognized with the Dean’s Scholarship in 2021.\nBrayden Boyko is committed to advancing his skills and pursuing a career in finance post-graduation, leveraging his extensive experience and diverse skill set to make significant contributions to the industry."
